## A.1 Physics in Generative Models

### A.1.1 Physics in Robotic World Models

#### A.1.1.1 [RoboScape: Physics-informed Embodied World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23135) Tsinghua University; Manifold AI.

Introduce two physics-informed tasks: 1)temporal depth prediction and 2) keypoint dynamic learning in the training of an embodied world model to predict visual observation given past observations and robotic actions using dual-branch co-autoregressive Transformer(DCT).
